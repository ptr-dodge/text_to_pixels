# Text to Pixels

> creative way to store text as an image


## Encoder.py
```sh
usage:
    python encoder.py "string to encode here" output.png
```

## Decoder.py
```sh
usage:
    python decoder.py output.png
    # output would be "string to encode here"
```

## Todo:
- read text from a file and convert it to image
- read hex bytes from a file and convert them to an image
- make the decoder work with all that
